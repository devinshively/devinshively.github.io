Hi, I’m Devin! I’m a software engineer living and working in the Silicon Valley.

I work mostly in Java, Go, Swift and Objective-C.

My main interest is in server-side technology but I am also involved in native mobile development. I am currently getting my feet wet with user facing web applications.

Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/devinshively) page to see what I’ve been up to recently! Though a lot of my projects I keep top secret ;)
